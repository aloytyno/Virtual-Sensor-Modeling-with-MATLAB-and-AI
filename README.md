# Virtual Sensor Modeling with MATLAB and AI

This repository demonstrates the use of MATLAB and AI to develop a virtual sensor for accurate estimation of aircraft air speed. This example heavily uses MATLAB's low code tools for data import, data cleaning and machine learning modeling.

## Usage
Browse into the directory "Demos" and open the Live Script "VirtualSensorModel.mlx".

## Toolboxes used
* MATLAB
* Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox
* Parallel COmputing toolbox (optional, to speed up model training)
